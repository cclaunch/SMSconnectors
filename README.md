connector to plug in SMS card or plug into an SMS socket

Hobbyists or restorers who need to connect to an IBM Standard Modular System (SMS) 
card or socket can use these PCBs to quickly make the connectors they need. 

IBM SMS was developed for their transistor generation of mainframe products, such 
as the IBM 1401 or 7094. The plug in card from that system uses a one sided 
connection with sixteen gold plated fingers to carry signals. 

Sockets that accepted SMS cards were built as a plastic housing with sixteen 
contacts that were springy and push against the inserted fingers to make
good contact. Often these had pins on the back for wire-wrap 
or push on clip connections. 

In addition to plug in cards with components, IBM built 'paddle connectors'
which had the same gold plated fingers but were connected to wiring for 
cabling within the system.

The PCB from this project can be used to make paddle cards and sockets, 
both with holes to solder wiring. It was designed so that two of these
PCBs together form an SMS socket, while one can be used as a paddle
card. 

There are four holes around the outside of the PCB and by using an 
appropriate thickness washer, a pair of cards can be assembled to 
form the socket. One side is marked Socket for Board and the other
is marked Insert in Sockets.

By placing the side with the fingers down, a pair have fingers
inside the sandwich in the proper orientation to siip over an
SMS card or paddle board. There is an extraneous set of fingers
on the outside of the bottom layer of the sandwich, but that 
is an artifact of avoiding the need to build a blank bottom
board. 

A single PCB is pushed into an SMS socket with the fingers
oriented to match the contacts.
