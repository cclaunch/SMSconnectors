# SMSconnectors
connector to plug in SMS card or plug into an SMS socket

Hobbyists or restorers who need to connect to an IBM Standard Modular System (SMS) 
card or socket can use these PCBs to quickly make the connectors they need. 

IBM SMS was developed for their transistor generation of mainframe products, such 
as the IBM 1401 or 7094. The plug in card from that system uses a one sided 
connection with seventeen gold plated fingers
